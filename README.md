I am writing an impactful blog posts of the significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

1.Union: Unions are basically expressed by the | symbol. Union means that a variable will take one value out of multiple values.This || symbol use in javascript but this | symbol use in typescript but two symbol work is same.

2.Intersection: Intersection are basically expressed by the & symbol. Intersection means that a variable will take all value out of multiple values. This && symbol use in javascript but this & symbol use in typescript but two symbol work is same. 

In TypeScript, the & symbol is used to define intersection types, which combine multiple types into one, whereas in JavaScript, the && symbol is used as a logical AND operator to evaluate boolean expressions.
